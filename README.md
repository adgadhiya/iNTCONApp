# iNTCONApp


This app is available on google play store. After learning android, I created this app.

iNTCON 
iNTCON is an App, using you can create groups or join groups and you can share many things which are listed below. or You can join our pre-created groups and download materials. Right now we've provided GTU Exam papers for all branches that you can download with single click. Below all the Apps features are given.

iNTCON Resources:
Sharing materials with your friends is easy task but sharing same material again and again makes you frustrated. Well you create your own group and Share your upload your material only one time. You can share same material across groups without uploading that second time.

iNTCON NOTICES:
Share notices with your friends and students anytime with attachment. So, forget Notice Board when you have Notice board in your Pocket.


iNTCON ACHIEVEMENTS:
Achievements plays a big role in institutes fame. But what if no one knows about institutes Achievements.By using this feature we can share our achievements with other Peoples.


iNTCON EVENTS:
Institute always organizes Events and Competitions. Because of lake of time it is not possible for us to send students for campaign every time. By using iNTCON Events we can tell others about the competition or Events or Workshops etc. 

It contains all the information related to Events like Events description. Event date and time, Participation fees, Last date for registration, Accommodation availability, Winner prize etc.
